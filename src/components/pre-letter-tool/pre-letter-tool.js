          We're going to ask you a few questions to find out more about the circumstances of the incident to give you a
          few pointers about the case. Then we'll ask for details for the defendant and where the incident occurred to
          generate a letter to notify the defendants. It will look a little like this:
        </P>
        <Lightbox />

        <P b="90px">
          If you have the defendant's registration you can find out if they are insured and get the details to notify
          the insurers directly. You need to use the Motor Insurer's Database{' '}
