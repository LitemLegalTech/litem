              As you were not riding with lights, this may pose a problem as the defendants will argue that they were
              unable to see you in order to avoid the incident. Alternatively, it may lead to a reduction in your
              damages for 'contributory negligence'. For more information see{' '}

            the type of injury, its severity and the length of time it lasts. In addition you are entitled to your
